# YOLOv8 Object Detection â€“ Signboard Detection Project

This project leverages the YOLOv8 deep learning model to perform object detection on **signboards** from real-world images. The goal is to accurately detect and classify signboards using a custom dataset, with model training, validation, and prediction workflows implemented in Python and Jupyter Notebook.
